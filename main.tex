\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the application of neural networks in predicting the trajectory of the Lorenz 63 system, a set of differential equations that showcase chaotic behavior. The Lorenz System was originally stipulated by Edward N. Lorenz in 1963 as a mathematical model for atmospheric convection. It is commonly used as a toy problem to explore chaos theory. Traditional numerical methods such as the Runga Kutta 4th order method can be used to solve and predict the system's behavior. This study explores the use of neural networks as an alternative approach to predict chaos. The methodology involves training a neural network on a dataset generated from the Lorenz system via the RK4 method. By using a small step size and high computational resources the network can generalize patterns and possibly later on efficiently predict the system's future state with different initial conditions. This paper aims to test the RNN LSTM, Transformers and RC-ESN network architectures. RNN and Transforms architectures are known for their ability to handle sequential data, while RC-ESN is known for its ability to capture chaotic systems. The results of the study will be compared to the the RK4 method to determine if the neural networks could surpass it with greater prediction horizon given similiar computational resources.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{The Lorenz System}

The original Lorenz system is a set of three differential equations. It is one of the earliest and most studied examples of systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. It is defined by the following equations:

\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \sigma(y - x) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\rho - z) - y \\
\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \beta z
\end{align}

where $x$, $y$, and $z$ make up the state, $t$ is time, and $\sigma$, $\rho$, and $\beta$ are parameters. Typically, the values $\sigma = 10$, $\rho = 28$, and $\beta = \frac{8}{3}$ are used.

The Lorenz system is known for its butterfly-shaped attractor, which is a set of two points the systems tends to evolve around, regardless of the starting conditions. The attractor is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:lorenz_attractor}.

\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM}

Neural networks are a type of machine learning AI model that are inspired by the structure of the human brain. They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, which represent neurons, that process input data and produce an output. These nodes are usually connected to each other with linear transformations called weights and biases. The weights and biases are the parameters of the network that intially are randomly initialized and are optimized during the training process. Via the process of stochastic gradient descent the network can compute a gradient to slowly shift the parameters and minimize the error of the network's predictions. Over time the network can learn to make accurate predictions on the training data.

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network architecture designed to recognize patterns in sequential data. What makes the RNN architecture special is that it's composed of a train of nodes, called cells, each connected to the next, where all the cells share the same parameters. When the input vector is fed to the first cell of the train, it creates an output and then the state of the node(the hidden state) is updated and passed along to the next cell. This update in hidden state makes it so the next cell can 'remember' the previous data inputed.

However, RNNs have a significant limitation in that they struggle to learn long term dependencies due to the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks  aim to solve this problem. The LSTM network is a modification of the RNN that introduces a second hidden state, called the cell state, which is updated differently from the traditional hidden state. This update process is controlled by some gates which detemine when to update the cell state. This modification of the hidden state is more effective when performing backpropgation which allows the network to learn long-term dependencies.

\subsection{Transformers}

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need"(2017) by Google. Unlike RNNs, Transformers do not process the data in sequence, instead, they process the entire sequence at once. Transformers transform the data into an embedding layer where the positions are encoded into the data vectors themselves. This makes the network highly parallelizable. Transfomers has been quite revolutionary and is the basis of the state-of-the-art model GPT-4.

The key innovation however in Transformers is the self-attention mechanism. In self-attention, each token in the input sequence is transformed with trainable weights into three vectors, a query $Q$, key $K$ and value $V$ vector. The query vector states what a given token is looking for, the key vector states what the token offers, whilst the value vector is the information the token contains.

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K , V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$$

The self-attention mechanism takes the dot product between the keys and queries of the tokens, divides it by the square root of the key dimension(to prevent too small gradients) and then applies softmax to create a weights matrix. The weights matrix is used to determine how much each token in the sequence should contribute to the value vector of another token. For example, let the tokens be words in a sentence. In the sentence "The cat sat on the mat", the word "cat" would have a high affinity for the word "mat"(a query vector looking for the object of the sentence) and a low affinity for the word "the". This mechanism allows the network to learn the relationships between the tokens in the sequence.

The self attention mechanism is usually applied multiple times on the same tokens in parallell. This is called multi-head attention. Each 'head' has its own trainable transformations to look for different things in the tokens. The results are then concatenated and then aggregated through a trainable transformation to create the final ouput of the multi-head layer.

\end{figure}

The multi-head layer is paired with a position-wise feed-forward layer. The feed-forward layer applies two trainable linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. The feed forward layer makes it so the network can learn more complex representations of the data. The multi-head layer and feed-forward layer is usually repeated in blocks to form the transformer network. Between the layers goes a residual conection called layer normalization. Each time a multi-head or feed-forward layer has made a computation the result is added to the residual connection. This makes the gradient flow more stable.
