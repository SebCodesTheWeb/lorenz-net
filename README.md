## Lorenz-net

This repository contains the code that was used in the "Which Neural Network Architecture is Optimal for Predicting Chaotic Dynamics" paper (Delgado, 2024).
Its a project mainly built in python to predict the Lorenz system using different machine learning models and a simple backend to frontend to visualize
the models predictions.
